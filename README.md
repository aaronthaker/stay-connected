Requirements to run application:
- Node.js - can be installed from https://nodejs.org/
- Angular CLI - can be installed using NPM (installed with Node.js) by running npm install -g @angular/cli

To run the application:
1. Pull repository and navigate to it in cmd/terminal/bash etc
2. Run 'npm install' inside the project root
3. Run 'ng serve' inside the project root - it should take a minute or two to compile then display a message 'Compiled Successfully'. Keep this running - to close use Ctrl+C
4. Open another terminal and navigate project root
5. Run 'npm run server' in second terminal
6. With both terminals still open, navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the application (check terminal log to see port - but will most likely be 4200)

Note: The MongoDB cloud is currently set to allow connections from anywhere.
